# My question: #
Hi, I will be 50 this year in August. I have 25 years of experience in IT of which 15 years is in Data Storage. Currently working as a Service Account Manager in Pure Storage and will be handling customers who use Pure Storage arrays as well as Cloud Block Store ( kind of a cloud version of flasharray). I've mostly managed storage products of EMC, a bit of HP 3Par and Pure Storage in the past and have varied work experience right from a Storage Admin to a Tech Lead, Team lead, ops manager and also in storage design and architecture. I'm comfortable with Linux and have done some shell and Perl scripting. I have a few questions about my career trajectory and up skilling. 

Would I be going in the right direction if I choose to go through AI way?  If it is the right way will the "Python Fundamentals" Udemy course by Fred Baptiste be good enough to learn basic Python. If you can go through the course content, it covers Numpy, Matplotlib and Pandas. Will that help in AI?

Or, should I think of going into devops? I don't want to be on call or work in shifts though. Also, not sure if I will get a good hike if I move to devops.

 I'm also looking into the Independent Director Program (IDP for short) from the Director's Institute, but I can choose only one of the options, either devops or AI or IDP. Can you please do a reaserch on these options and tell me which is better for me in terms of my current skill mapping , relevance to my experience and salary growth? My current salary is 38 lacs INR.  Once you ascertain which is the right one for me , can you give me a proper skill upgrade path? 


# Gemini's Answer: #
It's excellent that you're proactively thinking about your career at 50, especially with your extensive IT experience. Your background in data storage, encompassing various roles from administration to architecture, and your familiarity with Linux, shell, and Perl scripting, provide a solid foundation for new directions. Let's break down your options: AI, DevOps, and the Independent Director Program (IDP).

### 1. AI (Artificial Intelligence) Way

**Relevance to your experience and current skills:**
Your 15 years in data storage, especially with Pure Storage arrays and Cloud Block Store, is highly relevant to AI. AI and Machine Learning (ML) models are data-hungry. They require massive amounts of data for training and inferencing, and this data needs to be stored, managed, and accessed efficiently. Your expertise in storage architecture and performance, especially with high-performance flash arrays, directly translates to understanding the infrastructure needs of AI workloads. Pure Storage, in particular, is actively involved in providing storage solutions for AI and ML.

Your comfort with Linux and scripting (shell, Perl) is a good starting point. Python is the dominant language in AI/ML, so your scripting aptitude will help you pick it up quickly.

**Fred Baptiste's "Python Fundamentals" Udemy course:**
The course covering NumPy, Matplotlib, and Pandas is an *excellent* starting point for AI.
* **NumPy:** Essential for numerical computing in Python, forming the basis for array operations that are fundamental to ML algorithms.
* **Pandas:** Crucial for data manipulation and analysis, which is the very first step in any AI/ML project (data cleaning, preparation, exploration).
* **Matplotlib:** Important for data visualization, helping you understand data patterns and model performance.

While this course will give you a strong foundation in Python for data science, it's just the beginning for AI. You'll need to delve into machine learning algorithms, deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow or PyTorch), and specialized AI concepts after mastering these fundamentals.

**Salary Growth (AI Engineer in India):**
* Entry-level AI Engineer: Around ₹5,00,000 per annum.
* Mid-level: Around ₹10,00,000 per year.
* Experienced AI engineers: Can command salaries up to ₹50,00,000 annually.
Given your extensive experience, even if new to AI-specific roles, you'd likely fall into the mid-to-senior experienced bracket once you gain the relevant AI skills, potentially seeing a significant hike from your current 38 LPA. Your deep domain knowledge in data storage would be a valuable asset in architecting AI data pipelines.

**Would you be going in the right direction?** Yes, absolutely. The convergence of AI and data is massive. Your storage background will give you a unique edge in understanding the underlying infrastructure challenges of AI, allowing you to contribute to data-intensive AI projects.

### 2. DevOps Way

**Relevance to your experience and current skills:**
Your background as a Storage Admin, Tech Lead, Team Lead, and Operations Manager, combined with your comfort in Linux and scripting, makes you a strong candidate for a DevOps transition. DevOps is all about bridging the gap between development and operations, automating infrastructure, deployments, and monitoring. Your experience in managing storage products and your operational understanding are highly valuable. Your knowledge of Pure Storage arrays and Cloud Block Store is directly relevant to infrastructure-as-code and cloud automation within a DevOps context.

**On-call and shifts:** This is a valid concern. While many DevOps roles do involve on-call rotations, there are also positions that are more focused on architectural design, pipeline development, or specialized areas like security (DevSecOps) or FinOps (financial operations in the cloud), where on-call might be less frequent or managed by dedicated SRE teams. Senior DevOps architects or leads might also have less direct on-call responsibility compared to junior or mid-level engineers. It's crucial to clarify this during the job search.

**Salary Growth (DevOps Engineer in India):**
* 1-4 years experience: ₹6,85,738
* 5-9 years experience: ₹13,37,151
* 10-19 years experience: ₹21,27,928
* 20+ years experience: ₹25,00,000
While these are averages, your extensive experience and current salary of 38 LPA suggest you'd be targeting senior or architect-level DevOps roles. A direct "hike" might not be guaranteed initially if you're taking on a junior DevOps role (which isn't recommended given your experience), but with strategic upskilling, you could potentially command a competitive salary. The listed average for 20+ years is ₹25 LPA, which is lower than your current salary. However, top-tier DevOps architects and leads, especially with cloud expertise, can earn significantly more.

### 3. Independent Director Program (IDP) from the Director's Institute

**Relevance to your experience:**
This program is about corporate governance, board membership, and strategic oversight. Your 25 years of IT experience, with leadership roles in operations and service account management, has given you exposure to business processes, customer management, and potentially strategic thinking within an IT context. This broad business understanding, coupled with your deep technology background, could be valuable for a board.
The program covers topics like corporate governance, financial statements, risk, ESG, digital strategy, and cybersecurity, which are all areas where your IT background can provide unique insights. Being an independent director is about providing an unbiased perspective and contributing to strategic decision-making.

**Salary Growth:**
This isn't a direct "salary" in the traditional sense, but rather a remuneration for board meetings and potentially a sitting fee. Independent director positions are often taken on by seasoned professionals as a way to contribute their expertise at a strategic level and diversify their professional portfolio. The financial gain comes from directorship fees and the prestige/networking opportunities. It's less about a linear "hike" in employment salary and more about a different type of professional engagement.

### Comparison and Recommendation

Let's weigh these options based on your criteria:

**Current Skill Mapping & Relevance:**

* **AI:** High relevance. Your data storage background is a huge asset for data-intensive AI. Your Linux/scripting skills are a good starting point for Python.
* **DevOps:** High relevance. Your operational, management, and scripting experience is a strong fit. Your storage background complements cloud infrastructure management.
* **IDP:** Moderate to High relevance. Your extensive professional experience, especially in leadership and client-facing roles, provides a valuable foundation for strategic governance. Your deep technical knowledge would be a plus on boards dealing with digital transformation, cybersecurity, or data strategy.

**Salary Growth:**

* **AI:** High potential for significant salary growth, especially if you specialize in areas like MLOps (integrating ML models into production) or AI infrastructure, leveraging your storage expertise.
* **DevOps:** Potential for good salary, but it's crucial to target senior/architect roles or niche areas to get a hike from your current salary. A generic DevOps engineer role might not offer the immediate hike you're looking for, though it offers stability and high demand.
* **IDP:** Not a direct salary hike, but offers significant professional prestige, networking, and directorship fees. It's a different career path entirely, more about influence and strategic contribution than a regular employment salary.

**Considering your specific preferences (no on-call/shifts for DevOps):**

* **AI:** While some AI roles might involve production support, many roles are more focused on model development, research, or data engineering, which often have more standard working hours. MLOps, however, can sometimes have on-call components.
* **DevOps:** This is your biggest concern here. While some senior/architect roles might be less on-call heavy, a significant portion of DevOps involves ensuring system uptime and reliability, which often translates to on-call responsibilities. It's not impossible to find roles without it, but it limits your options.

**Why not strongly recommend DevOps (as the primary path)?**
While DevOps is a strong contender given your background, your aversion to on-call/shifts is a significant factor. While there are DevOps roles without them, they might be harder to find, especially for someone transitioning. Also, a general DevOps role might not offer the salary hike you desire compared to your current 38 LPA, unless you target very senior/architect roles right from the start, which requires substantial new skill acquisition.

**Why not IDP as the primary path?**
The IDP is an excellent option for long-term career diversification and leveraging your senior experience at a strategic level. However, it's not a direct employment path with a guaranteed salary hike. It's more of a parallel pursuit for seasoned professionals to give back and expand their influence. It can be something you pursue *after* solidifying your technical direction.
